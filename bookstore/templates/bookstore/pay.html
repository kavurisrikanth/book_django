                <p>
                    Your order has been placed. Well, not really...<br>
                    See, this website doesn't <em>actually</em> place an order. The order details are just stored
                    in our database. You can see which non-orders you've non-placed, though.<br>
                    <br>
                    This website was a bit of a misdirect, wasn't it?<br>
                    As recompense, we give you the image on the left.<br>
                    Enjoy. :)
